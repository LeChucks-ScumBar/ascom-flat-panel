# ASCOM-Compatible Flat Panel


Thank you for charing this project jlecomte
This is the original project:
https://github.com/jlecomte/ascom-flat-panel

For my Flatpanel I use a Arduino nano and change the OCR register and TCCR to change the PWM frequency from 490 Hz to 20kHz on Pin10

For driving the leds from the Flat I use this FET Trigger Switch Drive Module Board
